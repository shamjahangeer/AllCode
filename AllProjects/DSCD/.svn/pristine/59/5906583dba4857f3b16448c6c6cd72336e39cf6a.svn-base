     Hold (TH) Off Date</A>. One 'grace day' is added to the TH Off Date 
    for calculation purposes only if the shipment is already late.</P>

    If the TH period is between the Customer Request Date and the Shipped 
    Date, the TH period will be subtracted from the delinquency period.

    the TH period, the shipment is considered on-time, with no variance.</P>

   <B>NOTE:</B> The Request to Ship variance will be calculated for 
   shipments only. This is a Customer Variable and a Standard Default calculation.
