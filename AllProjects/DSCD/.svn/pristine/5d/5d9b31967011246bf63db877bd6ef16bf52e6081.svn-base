   If a shipment was on Temporary Hold and the <A HREF="Dsc00309.htm">Commit
    Date</A> is within the Temporary Hold period, performance is tracked 
   from the <A HREF="Dsc00301.htm">Temporary Hold Off Date</A> . One 
   'grace day' is added to the Commit Date for calculation purposes only 
   if the shipment is already late.</P>
  <P>
   If a Temporary Hold period is between the Commit Date and the <A HREF="Dsc00289.htm">Shipped
    Date</A>, the Temporary Hold period will be subtracted from the 
   delinquency period. One day is added to the Temporary Hold period if 
   the Temporary Hold Off Date is less than the Shipped Date.</P>
  <P>
   If both the Shipped Date and the Commit Date fall within the 
   Temporary Hold period, the shipment is considered on-time, with no variance.</P>
  <P>
   <B>Note</B>: The following are examples of the TH (Temporary Hold) 
   calculation Logic:</P>
  <P>
   If Commit Date and Shipped Date are<B> on or within</B> the TH 
   period, the shipment is on-time.</P>
  <P>
   If Commit and Shipped Dates are <B>both before or both after</B> the 
   TH period, the calculation is the standard Commit Date to Shipped 
   Date comparison.</P>
  <P>
   If the Commit Date is <B>before</B> the TH On Date and the Shipped 
   Date is <B>greater than</B> the TH Off Date, the calculation is 
   Commit to Ship, minus the TH period plus 1 day.</P>
  <P>
   If the Commit Date is <B>before</B> the TH On Date and the Shipped 
   Date <B>equals</B> the TH Off Date, the calculation is Commit to 
   Ship, minus the TH period.</P>
  <P>
   If the Commit Date is <B>within</B> the TH period and the Shipped 
   Date is <B>greater than</B> the TH Off Date, the calculation is TH 
   Off Date (plus 1 day) to Shipped Date.
