    Time Window Rules</B></P>
  <P>
   In addition to the rules applied to all Delivery Scorecard windows 
   and schedule detail windows, Lead Time windows have the following 
   additional rules:</P>
  <P>
   <B>General Data Display</B></P>
  <OL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Lead Time allows the option to show leadtime for opens or leadtime 
    for shipments.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Customer Lead Time is the number of work days between the date the 
    order was received and the <A HREF="Dsc00295.htm">Customer Requested Date</A>;
     Tyco Electronics Lead Time is the number of work days between the 
    date the order was received and the <A HREF="Dsc00288.htm">Schedule Date</A>.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Lead Time measurements are straight measurement variances and 
    percentages (measured against zero (0) Days Early and zero (0) Days 
    Late) for both a Received to Schedule comparison (Tyco Electronics 
    Lead Time) and a Received to Customer Request comparison (Customer 
    Lead Time).</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Data within Lead Time columns is cumulative as you read from left to 
    right across the window. For example, data in column 2 is the sum of 
    the data in columns 0, 1, and 2.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    The Total Number of Schedules = the total number of shipments or 
    opens. Percentages are Leadtime schedule for x day(s)/ total number 
    of schedules.</P>
   </OL>
  <P>
   <B>Field Displays</B></P>
  <OL START="6">
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    The Days Early and (Days) Late fields do not apply to open schedules 
    and will not be included as window parameters.</P>

   <B>Date Range</B></P>
  <OL START="7">
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    A Monthly Date Range of 2 months or a Daily Date Range of 62 days (2 
    months of days) out of the available data (current month plus prior 
    15 months) can be viewed at one time.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    When using a date range, all records where <A HREF="Dsc00296.htm">Receive
     Date</A> falls within the date range entered will be shown.
