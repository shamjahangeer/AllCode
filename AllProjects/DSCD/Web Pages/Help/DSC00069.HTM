    If a shipped schedule has JIT shipments within its total (denoted by 
    a <B>J</B> above the total), position your cursor on that daily total 
    of schedules shipped.</P>
   <P>
    <B>Note</B>: A <B>J</B> positioned above a daily total indicates 
    there are just-in-time (JIT) shipments within that total. JIT 
    schedules are measured to a window of 0 Days Early and 0 Days Late, 
    regardless of <A HREF="Dsc00530.htm">Standard Default</A> or <A HREF="Dsc00531.htm">Customer
     Variable</A> window. The Early, On-Time, and Late-shipments and 
    percentages will show JIT as early, on-time, or late to a 0 Days 
    Early/Days Late window.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Position the cursor on the total of schedules shipped (the quantity 
    not the character J). A pop-up window displays showing the number of 
    JIT shipments and Non-JIT shipments that comprise that shipment total.
