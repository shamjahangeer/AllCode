   9999-99-99 signifies a non-schedule date. Whenever a shipment is made against a non-scheduled date, performance is always reflected as -999.

   <B>NOTE:</B> The Schedule to Ship variance will be calculated for shipments only. The Schedule to Ship variance is a Customer Variable and an Standard Default calculation. The normal Schedule to Ship measurement will be calculated as both Customer Variable and Standard Default, while the Shipping Facility Performance measurement is only calculated as Standard default.

   STS is calculated using the original schedule date to understand how well TE perform to the original commit date. While we need to adjust the schedule date for our internal planning, we never measure our selves to any date other than the original date. If we continually change the schedule date due to circumstances we could always be on time and that would not make sense.
