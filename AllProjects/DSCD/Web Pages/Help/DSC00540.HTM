    Variance Logic</B></P>
  <P>
   Following is the logic that will be used to calculate shipment 
   variances. (<B>Note</B>: In the following logic, Commit Date can be 
   defined as the earliest of Schedule Date or Earliest Expedite Date). 
   These rules apply to both JIT and Non-JIT customers, except where 
   otherwise noted.</P>
  <P>
   <B>&quot;Customer Variable&quot;</B> refers to a calculation that 
   takes the customer's delivery window into consideration - the 
   variance represents the number of days outside the customer's window.</P>
  <P>
   <B>&quot;Standard Default&quot;</B> refers to a calculation that does 
   not take the customer's delivery window into consideration - this 
   variance represents the number of days earlier or later than zero. 
   For online viewing of this variance, Tyco Electronics will set a 
   default window and then position the variance either inside or 
   outside that window, depending on the value of the variance.</P>
