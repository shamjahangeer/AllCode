   If a shipment was on Credit Review, performance is tracked from the <A HREF="Dsc00310.htm">Credit
    Off Date</A> or from the <A HREF="Dsc00288.htm">Schedule Date</A>, 
   whichever is the latest. One 'grace day' is added to the Commit Date 
   for calculation purposes only if a shipment is already late.</P>
  <P>
   If the Credit Off Date is <B>greater than or equal to</B> the <A HREF="Dsc00288.htm">Schedule
    Date</A> and the shipment is already late, the calculation is Credit 
   Off Date plus 1 day, unless the Shipped Date = the Credit Off Date.</P>
  <P>
   If the Credit Off Date is <B>before</B> the Schedule Date, the 
   calculation is Commit Date to Shipped Date.
