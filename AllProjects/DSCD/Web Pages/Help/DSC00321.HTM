   The starting and ending date from which Delivery Scorecard data can 
   be viewed.</P>
  <P>
   It is suggested to use the monthly (YYYY-MM) method for specifying 
   date ranges as opposed to the daily (YYYY-MM-DD) method, because the 
   monthly method will greatly reduce the amount of time it takes for 
   the requested report to load.</P>
  <P>
   When using the daily method to specify a date range, note that only a 
   35-day range of dates is permitted in the generated report.
