=>Library Cache(shared_pool_size `parameter)

Stores information about sql parse(validation of the objects and its syntax) and execution path.Memory is allocated
to process sql and plsql statments
Stores compiled programme units,functions,packages,procedures 


=>Data dictionary Cache((shared_pool_size `parameter)

Keep information of database files,tables,indexes,columns,users,privileges and other database objects
During parse phase oracle database looks data dictionary cache to check for the validation of the database objects
Caching the data dictonary information into memory increases the response time on queries.

if the data dictionary cache is very small then the oracle database looks for data dictionary tables.These queries are called recrusive calls 
and it is slower than the query used to check data dictinary cache for the information


=>Database buffer cache (DB_BLOCK_SIZE,db_cache_size PARAMETER)

it stores copies of the data blocks that have been retrieved from the data files

db_cache_advice can be set to gather statistics and statistics can be seen in V$DB_CACHE_ADVICE.
oracle database can be created with a standard block size and up to four non standard block size and non standard block size 
can have any power of 2 value between 2kb to 32kb in buffer cache. 
and if db_cache_advice is turned on will create overhead on memory and cpu


=>Redolog buffer cache(log_buffer parameter)

It contains information on changes done for data file blocks.These informations are called redo entries.These entries keep information
on insert update delete create,alter ,drop

=>Large Pool(Large_pool_size parameter)

(Optional area of memory in the SGA and configured only in the Shared Server enviornment) and mainly used to release the burden
placed on the shared pool.This memory is used for backup and restore operation,io slaves,session memory(UGA).

=>Java Pool(Java Pool size)

It services the parsing information required for java commands.Required if you are using java and its default size is 24m.

=>program global area
PGA is used for dedicated oracle server.it is allocated when server process started and deallocates when it ends.
The memory is used for 
Sort area,
session information(user information,privileges and performance statistics for that session)
stack space
Cursor State


=>DBWR Process
The server process records changes to rollback and data blocks in the buffer cache. Database
Writer (DBWn) writes the dirty buffers from the database buffer cache to the data files. It
ensures that a sufficient number of free buffers—buffers that can be overwritten when server
processes need to read in blocks from the data files—are available in the database buffer
cache. Database performance is improved because server processes make changes only in the
buffer cache.

DBWn writes when:
• Checkpoint
• Dirty buffers threshold
reached
• No free buffers
• Timeout
• RAC ping request
• Tablespace offline
• Tablespace read only
• Table DROP or
TRUNCATE
• Tablespace BEGIN
BACKUP

=>Log Writer(LGWR)

LGWR performs sequential writes from the redo log buffer cache to the redo log file under
the following situations:
• When a transaction commits
• When the redo log buffer cache is one-third full
• When there is more than a megabyte of changes records in the redo log buffer cache
• Before DBWn writes modified blocks in the database buffer cache to the data files
• Every 3 seconds.
Because the redo is needed for recovery, LGWR confirms the commit only after the redo is
written to disk.
LGWR can also call on DBWn to write to the data files.

=>SYSTEM MONITOR(SMON)

• Instance recovery:
– Rolls forward
changes in the
redo logs
– Opens the
database for
user access
– Rolls back
uncommitted
transactions
• Coalesces free
space ever 3 sec
• Deallocates
temporary segments
Control

=>PROCESS MONITOR(PMON)

The background process PMON cleans up after failed processes by:
• Rolling back the user’s current transaction
• Releasing all currently held table or row locks
• Freeing other resources currently reserved by the user
• Restarts dead dispatchers

=>CHECK POINT(CKPT)

Signalling DBWn
at checkpoints
• Updating datafile
headers with
checkpoint
information
• Updating control
files with
checkpoint

=>Archiver (ARCN)

Optional background process
• Automatically archives online redo logs when
ARCHIVELOG mode is set
• Preserves the record of all changes made to the
database


=>PROGRAM GLOBAL AREA(PGA)

Sort area: Used for any sorts that may be required to process the SQL statement
• Session information: Includes user privileges and performance statistics for the session
• Cursor state: Indicates the stage in the processing of the SQL statements that are
currently used by the session
• Stack space: Contains other session variables
