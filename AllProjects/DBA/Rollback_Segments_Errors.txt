Insufficient space for transactions
----------------------------------
->no space in the tablespace

Solution
-------
extend the data files
Add new data files
enable autmatic extension of the data files
increase the maxextens in rollback segments
shrink the rollback segments

->Maxextents reached for the segments
increase maxextents
recreate the segments with the larger extents

ex:-ALTER TABLESPACE ts_name STORAGE (MAXEXTENTS n);

error:-ORA-01562 insufficient space in the tablespace for rollback segments to extend
       ORA-01628 tHE NUMBER OF EXTENTS HAS REACHED  the maxextents unable to add additional extents


Read consistency error or snapshot too old errros

-------------------------

The transaction slot in the rollback header has been reused
before image in the rollback segments has been overwritten by another errors

solution:

increase the maxextents in the rollback segments
a higher optimal value
a higher minimum extent value



Blocking transactions
-------------------------------------
if the extents  have lesser transactions but still active and segments cannot access this extents as it is active
then the oracle will allcoate the new extents which results in the rollback segment growth
To avoid this we need to kill those blocking transaction if it is idle for more or ask the user to kill the transaction

to find the blocking transaction

SELECT s.sid, s.serial#, t.start_time, t.xidusn,
 s.username
 FROM v$session s, v$transaction t, v$rollstat r
 WHERE s.saddr = t.ses_addr
 AND t.xidusn = r.usn
 AND ((r.curext = t.start_uext-1) OR
 ((r.curext = r.extents-1) AND t.start_uext=0));



Error in taking tablespace offline
--------------------------------------
If tablespace contains one or more active rollback segments it cannot be taken offline

Steps to take the rollback segments offline

1. Query DBA_ROLLBACK_SEGS to find which rollback segments are in the tablespace.
2. Take all rollback segments in the tablespace offline.
3. Check V$TRANSACTION to find which transactions are currently using these rollback
segments.
4. Use V$SESSION to obtain the user name and session information.
5. Kill the session or have the user end the transaction.
6. Take the tablespace offline.
