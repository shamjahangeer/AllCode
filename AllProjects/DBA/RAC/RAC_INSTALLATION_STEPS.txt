->ORACLE cLUSTER READY sERVICES(CRS)::

 It requires two files..oracle cluster registry(OCR) and CRS Voting Disk file which must
be shared across all nodes.
To store this file we can use either raw devices or ocfs.
We cannot use ASM
These CRS files need to be available for any RAC instance to run.
Oracle's data files, control files are stored in ASM
The shared storage space can be used as raw devices, or by using a cluster file system or ASM.


->Fire wire based shared storage
It is very important to get an external FireWire drive that allows concurrent access for more than one server.
Otherwise the disk(s) and partitions can only be seen by one server at a time.

------

->For installing the oracle RAC we need sofwares for 1) Cluster Ready Services 10.1.0.2 and 2) oracle database 10g 10.1.0.2)
