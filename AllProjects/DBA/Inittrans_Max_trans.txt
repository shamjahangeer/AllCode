=>INITRANS is a block level storage parameter which can be specified while creating a object.
=>can be a maximum of 255 concurrent sessions that can access a block at any given time. So the maximumITPUB???? i,?#S#{5o6a&d x
value for MAXTRANS parameter is 255. The value specified through INITRANS are taken into considerationITPUB????x:JO8Qa#g c3v8l
for creating the initial number of ITLs (Intersted Transaction Entries) in the block

=>While creating the table if INITRANS 20 is specified, then 20 different ITL slots will be created in the blockITPUB????D8Q]L"c.S
transaction variable header.

=>The rule is
the total size allocated for initial ITLs SHOULD be LESS THAN 50% of the database block size" 
sizeof(INITIAL ITLs) <  ( 50 % of the DATABASE BLOCK SIZE )


=>s I mentioned before, not more than 50 % of the block size are utilized for these headers.  For a 2k block
sized database, the maximum ITLs during intial allocation is 41. Each ITL takes 24 bytes of space in theITPUB????+J#Y9ya _F
header.

41 * 24 = 984 bytes.   This is 48 % of the total block size.

J]]b2}1kHq0For 4k block:   83 * 24 = 1992 bytes.(48%)  
8k block:   169 * 24 = 4056 bytes. (48%)  

Follow the above 5 steps to check the ITL allocation for different block sizes. So don't be surprised whenIT
you don't see the value in the dump you set for INITRANS.



Note:we increase the initrans to 3 for the transaction seriallizable
