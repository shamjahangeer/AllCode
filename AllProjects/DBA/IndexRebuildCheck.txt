To obtain information about an index:

analyze index <index_name> validate structure;

This populates the table ‘index_stats’. It should be noted that this table contains only one row and therefore only one index can be analysed at a time.

An index should be considered for rebuilding under any of the following conditions:

* The percentage of deleted rows exceeds 30% of the total, i.e. if
del_lf_rows / lf_rows > 0.3.
* If the ‘HEIGHT’ is greater than 4.
* If the number of rows in the index (‘LF_ROWS’) is significantly smaller than ‘LF_BLKS’ this can indicate a large number of deletes, indicating that the index should be rebuilt.

Specify Index Block Space Use

When an index is created for a table, data blocks of the index are
 filled with the existing values in the table up to PCTFREE. 
 The space reserved by PCTFREE for an index block is only used when 
 a new row is inserted into the table and the corresponding index entry 
 must be placed in the correct index block (that is, between preceding 
 and following index entries).

If no more space is available in the appropriate index block, 
the indexed value is placed where it belongs (based on the lexical set ordering). 
Therefore, if you plan on inserting many rows into an indexed table, PCTFREE should be 
high to accommodate the new index values. If the table is relatively static without many 
inserts, PCTFREE for an associated index can be low so that fewer blocks are required
 to hold the index data.
