Server side SQL*Net trace:

All these parameters should be configured in the listener.ora file. 


By default, server logs and traces are stored in listener.log and listener.trc files under the $ORACLE_HOME/network/trace directory.

Note that, by default, logging is turned on and this behavior can be changed with the 
logging_ parameter of the listener.ora file. One can switch between different trace standards 
on the client side using the trace_level_client parameter of sqlnet.ora. 
At the server side, the trace level parameter is called trace_level_ and it should be included in the listener.ora


On the client side, it is possible to define the directory where to put log and trace files in the sqlnet.ora file using the log_directory_client and trace_directory_client parameters, respectively.  The SQL*Net tracing log and trace file names are defined with the log_directory_client and trace_directory_client parameters of the sqlnet.ora file.

By default, trace on UNIX systems is written to $ORACLE_HOME/network/trace/sqlnet.trc,
 and log is written to sqlnet.log file under the same directory.
 On the server side,log and trace destinations can be defined with the following parameters: log_directory_, log_file_,
 trace_directory_ and trace_file_.



STEP 1:  Make a SQL*net trace file directory on the client machine called c:\trace

STEP 2:  Add the following lines to your sqlnet.ora file on your client PC:

trace_level_client = 16
trace_file_client = cli
trace_directory_client = c:\trace 
trace_unique_client = on 
trace_timestamp_client = on 
trace_filelen_client = 100 
trace_fileno_client = 2 
log_file_client = cli 
log_directory_client = c:\trace\log 
tnsping.trace_directory = c:\trace\trace 
tnsping.trace_level = admin

STEP 3:  When you are finished with the SQL*trace, be sure to remove the lines from the sqlnet.ora file.
