->How to Enable/Disable Recycle Bin

The Following property sets the Recycle Bin to be enabled or not for the DB.

SELECT Value FROM V$parameter WHERE Name = 'recyclebin';


->The following commands are used to enable or Disable the Feature


SQL > ALTER SYSTEM SET recyclebin = ON;
or
SQL > ALTER SESSION SET recyclebin = ON;

SQL > ALTER SYSTEM SET recyclebin = OFF;
or
SQL > ALTER SESSION SET recyclebin = OFF;


->Use the following commands to show all the objects that are stored in Recycle Bin,

SQL > SHOW RECYCLEBIN;
Or
SQL > SELECT * FROM USER_RECYCLEBIN;

->The Following Example explains the moving the object to the Recyclebin

CREATE TABLE TEST_RBIN(VAL   NUMBER);
INSERT INTO TEST_RBIN(VAL) VALUES(10);
COMMIT;
DROP TABLE TEST_RBIN;

->How to Restore the Objects

FLASHBACK TABLE <<Table_Name >> TO BEFORE DROP;

->It is possible to restore the table in to different name by issuing the following SQL Command,

 FLASHBACK TABLE << Dropped Table Name >> TO BEFORE DROP RENAME TO <<New Table Name >>;

->Using the above statement, its possible to restore the various version of the table data if the table
is created and Dropped more than once.

While restoring system restores the table in Descending order.the below statement shows the table has been created and dropped 
thrice

SHOW RECYCLEBIN;

ORIGINAL NAME    RECYCLEBIN NAME            	     OBJECT TYPE      DROP TIME
 ---------------- ------------------------------  ------------     -------------------
TEST_RBIN        BIN$2e51YTa3RSK8TL/mPy+FuA==$0   TABLE        	2010-05-27:15:23:43
TEST_RBIN        BIN$5dF60S3GSEO70SSYREaqCg==$0   TABLE        	2010-05-27:15:23:43
TEST_RBIN        BIN$JHCDN9YwQR67XjXGOJcCIg==$0 TABLE        	2010-05-27:15:23:4

FLASHBACK TABLE TEST_RBIN TO BEFORE DROP RENAME TO TEST_RBIN1;
FLASHBACK TABLE TEST_RBIN TO BEFORE DROP RENAME TO TEST_RBIN2;
FLASHBACK TABLE TEST_RBIN TO BEFORE DROP RENAME TO TEST_RBIN3;


Note:
The un-drop feature brings the table back to its original name, but not the associated objects like 
indexes and triggers, which are left with the recycled names. Sources such as views and 
procedures defined on the table are not recompiled and remain in the invalid state. 
These old names must be retrieved manually and then applied to the flashed-back table

->Clearing the recyclebin

PURGE TABLE << Table_Name >>

Note:

Objects in the Recycle Bin will be automatically purged by the space reclamation process if

1. A user creates a new table or adds data that causes his/her quota to be exceeded.
2. The tablespace needs to extend its file size to accommodate create/insert operations
